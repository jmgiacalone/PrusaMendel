Open3DP - Forms for Mold Making

Open3DP.me.washington.edu

This is the alpha release of these parts.  

All forms are to be used directly except one must put tape across 
one side of the whole Mold_4_XMotor in the motor/motor mounting holes
region.   The tape acts as a separator to keep the mold material from 
crossing through the form (thus making a one sided mold possible).
